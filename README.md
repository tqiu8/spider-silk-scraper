### Setting up

To execute code in this project, you should have some version of python 3 (anything >3.6 should be fine!).  You can type `python3 --version` into your terminal to see which version of python you currently have.  You can download the latest version of python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have the `python3` command in your terminal, `cd` into this folder in your terminal and type `make environment` to install the dependencies for the project, and then `make notebook` to start executing the jupyter environment.  If you have any trouble with installation feel free to post in the [#biomaterials-expressivematter](https://genspacemembers.slack.com/archives/C02J46T6AAC) channel on the Genspace Slack.
